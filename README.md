Module Eight Journal – Reflection

Summary of the DriverPass Project

The DriverPass project was created for a client who wanted a system to help students prepare for their DMV driving tests. The system needed to include online practice tests, lesson scheduling with instructors, and integration with DMV updates. The goal was to improve pass rates while making the process easier for students, instructors, and administrators.

What I Did Well

I feel that I did particularly well in gathering and interpreting the client’s requirements from the interview transcript. I was able to translate those needs into clear use cases, UML diagrams, and a system design that aligned with the client’s expectations. I also made sure the design was realistic, secure, and user-friendly.

What I Would Revise

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the Gantt chart and activity diagrams. At first, I struggled with tools like Excel and Lucidchart, but once I got comfortable, the diagrams became much clearer. A cleaner, more consistent visual style would strengthen the professional quality of the documents.

How I Interpreted User Needs

I interpreted the client’s needs by carefully analyzing the DriverPass interview transcript and mapping each requirement to functional system components. For example, the client’s concern about DMV record accuracy led me to include DMV integration as a system requirement. Considering the user’s needs is essential, because if the system doesn’t align with their goals, it won’t be successful.

My Approach to Designing Software

When designing software, I start by breaking down the client’s goals into smaller, actionable requirements. I use tools like UML diagrams, activity diagrams, and requirements documents to visualize how the system will function. In the future, I would use iterative design strategies, gathering feedback from stakeholders early and often, so the system design evolves with their needs.
